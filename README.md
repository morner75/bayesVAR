# Baysian Vector Autoregression 

This is a study project for Bayesian vector autoregression. 
It aims to replace the BEARS toolbox of MATLAB developed by the European Central Bank (ECB) to design macroeconomic scenarios for stress-testing South Korea's financial institutions in the Financial Supervisory Service.
The main functions are focused on conditional forecasting given structural shock in the financial market.

### limitations
This package is developed with only $\texttt{R}$, and so the implementation of the function may seem to be slow. 
I have a plan to write the Monte Carlo simuation part of the package with $\texttt{C++}$, but it may take time compared to other priorities.
